    <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">Why Animal Research is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental 
      agents impact human health (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). The biological similarities between humans and 
      other species means that they can, on some occasions, be the only effective model for 
      research where responses to agents is too complex to be modelled in any other way. 
      Such animal models provide key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and responses 
      to local, national and international health security incidents, protecting the population from existing 
      and emerging health threats.
    </p>
    <p>
  More specifically, animals are used within UKHSA research to:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improve methods of diagnosis and to identify the severity of new and emerging pathogens</li>
    <li>support the development of, and access to, new vaccines or therapies for the main public health threats and emerging or re-emerging diseases, including those on the UKHSA list of pathogens</li>
    <li>characterise the effects of low dose radiation on colon cancer, leukaemia, cataract, or cardiovascular disease development</li>
    <li>investigate the additional positive effects of sunlight beyond the associated benefits of vitamin D</li>
    <li>identify the potential toxicity of inhaled particles, including particulate matter and nanomaterials</li>
    <li>inform policies, interventions and messaging campaigns to better protect human health</li>
    <li>improve the management of casualties in acute radiation, chemical and other environmental incidents</li>
  </ul>

          How is Animal Research Regulated in the UK
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use of animals for research in the UK is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. 
          This stipulates that animal research can only be performed under a specified Project Licence (PPL),
          within an organisation with a Place Establishment Licence (PEL), and by individuals holding a Personal Licence (PIL). 
          ASPA is implemented and regulated by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) with the Home Office. 
          More information on ASPA and its operation can be found here.
        </p>
        <p>
       One requirement of the ASPA is to have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB)to ensure that the use 
       of animals is carefully considered, justified and performed to high standards; all opportunities for reduction, 
       refinement and replacement (the 3Rs) are implemented; and the four commitments of the Understanding Animal Research 
       (UAR) <a href="https://concordatopenness.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concordat on Openness</a> are upheld.

        <strong><em>Figure 4: The 3Rs in Animal Research</em></strong><br>
        The 3Rs are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in research: Replace (use alternatives to animals where possible), Reduce (use as few animals as necessary), and Refine (minimize suffering and improve welfare).
      </figcaption>
      <div style="height: 2rem;"></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 red"><strong>Refinement</strong></h5>
        <p>
          Refinement is centred around improving the experience of the research animal by minimising pain, suffering, distress and harm. At UKHSA the care and conditions for animals in research are continually refined to minimise harm and distress as much as possible. Practices are regularly assessed and updated to enhance animal well-being at every opportunity. This has involved ensuring group housing for social animals and developing novel and exciting enrichment activities for the wide variety of species we use.
          Examples of refinement include housing animals in socially compatible groups wherever possible, provision of enrichment appropriate to the species to encourage natural behaviours and adopting sampling techniques in line with advice from bodies such as <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NC3Rs</a> through regular liaison. In addition, we have refined studies through the use of advanced medical imaging that provides critical data whilst being non-invasive.

  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h5 class="mt-3 mb-2 red"><strong>Replacement</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Replacement is the use of non-animal alternatives in place of using animals. While suitable non-animal alternatives that completely model the complex human health responses to environmental hazards or pathogens are currently unavailable, UKHSA is working on multiple new approach methodologies (NAMs). This includes <a href="https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/microphysiological-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Organ on a Chip'</a>. systems help develop vaccines, drugs and therapeutics against a broad range of dangerous infectious diseases including MERS and Influenza virus. In the long term, we anticipate that this research will accelerate the rate of development of novel medicines. In addition, we are developing and validating new cell-based tests to support animal-free chemical safety regulation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 red"><strong>Reduction</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Reduction involves minimising the number of animals used in research while maintaining the validity of the data collected, ensuring that no animals are used unnecessarily. Throughout the lifetime of our research projects using animals, we continually review and employ improved statistical approaches, which have helped us to use fewer animals than originally planned. Wherever possible we also share animal tissue and results with internal and external collaborators to maximise the data generated from animals and allow new technologies to add value to existing samples, thereby preventing duplication of experiments.
        At UKHSA we use in vitro screening of potential countermeasures wherever possible and we have established a comprehensive archive of animal blood and tissues that can be shared across the organisation to develop new technologies or apply new analysis that will enhance our interpretation of previously conducted studies, removing the need for additional animals.
