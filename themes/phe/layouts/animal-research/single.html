        UKHSA research. Alongside epidemiological and cell studies, animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental agents impact human health. This provides key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and incident responses to protect the population from existing and emerging health threats.

    <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">Why Animal Research is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental 
      agents impact human health (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). The biological similarities between humans and 
      other species means that they can, on some occasions, be the only effective model for 
      research where responses to agents is too complex to be modelled in any other way. 
      Such animal models provide key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and responses 
      to local, national and international health security incidents, protecting the population from existing 
      and emerging health threats.

      The animal work conducted at the 3 UKHSA sites <i><strong>Fig.2</strong></i> provides an essential 
      capability for health security as well as opportunities for scientific 
      advancement aligned to UKHSA’s mission of interest to R&D funders internationally. 
      UKHSA has substantial experience in assisting in the development of countermeasures 
      to protect the population from health threats.

          How is Animal Research Regulated in the UK
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use of animals for research in the UK is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. 
          This stipulates that animal research can only be performed under a specified Project Licence (PPL),
          within an organisation with a Place Establishment Licence (PEL), and by individuals holding a Personal Licence (PIL). 
          ASPA is implemented and regulated by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) with the Home Office. 
          More information on ASPA and its operation can be found here.
        </p>
        <p>
       One requirement of the ASPA is to have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB)to ensure that the use 
       of animals is carefully considered, justified and performed to high standards; all opportunities for reduction, 
       refinement and replacement (the 3Rs) are implemented; and the four commitments of the Understanding Animal Research 
       (UAR) <a href="https://concordatopenness.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concordat on Openness</a> are upheld.
