        The 3Rs are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in research: Replace (use alternatives to animals where possible), Reduce (use as few animals as necessary), and Refine (minimize suffering and improve welfare).

        <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 red"><strong>Refinement</strong></h5>
        <p>
          Refinement is centred around improving the experience of the research animal by minimising pain, suffering, distress and harm. At UKHSA the care and conditions for animals in research are continually refined to minimise harm and distress as much as possible. Practices are regularly assessed and updated to enhance animal well-being at every opportunity. This has involved ensuring group housing for social animals and developing novel and exciting enrichment activities for the wide variety of species we use.
          Examples of refinement include housing animals in socially compatible groups wherever possible, provision of enrichment appropriate to the species to encourage natural behaviours and adopting sampling techniques in line with advice from bodies such as <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NC3Rs</a> through regular liaison. In addition, we have refined studies through the use of advanced medical imaging that provides critical data whilst being non-invasive.

      <h5 class="mt-3 mb-2 red"><strong>Replacement</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Replacement is the use of non-animal alternatives in place of using animals. While suitable non-animal alternatives that completely model the complex human health responses to environmental hazards or pathogens are currently unavailable, UKHSA is working on multiple new approach methodologies (NAMs). This includes <a href="https://research.ukhsa.gov.uk/our-research/microphysiological-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Organ on a Chip'</a>. systems help develop vaccines, drugs and therapeutics against a broad range of dangerous infectious diseases including MERS and Influenza virus. In the long term, we anticipate that this research will accelerate the rate of development of novel medicines. In addition, we are developing and validating new cell-based tests to support animal-free chemical safety regulation.

    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 red"><strong>Reduction</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Reduction involves minimising the number of animals used in research while maintaining the validity of the data collected, ensuring that no animals are used unnecessarily. Throughout the lifetime of our research projects using animals, we continually review and employ improved statistical approaches, which have helped us to use fewer animals than originally planned. Wherever possible we also share animal tissue and results with internal and external collaborators to maximise the data generated from animals and allow new technologies to add value to existing samples, thereby preventing duplication of experiments.
        At UKHSA we use in vitro screening of potential countermeasures wherever possible and we have established a comprehensive archive of animal blood and tissues that can be shared across the organisation to develop new technologies or apply new analysis that will enhance our interpretation of previously conducted studies, removing the need for additional animals.
