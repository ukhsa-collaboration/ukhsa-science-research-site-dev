        UKHSA research. Alongside epidemiological and cell studies, animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental agents impact human health. This provides key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and incident responses to protect the population from existing and emerging health threats.

    <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">Why Animal Research is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental 
      agents impact human health (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). The biological similarities between humans and 
      other species means that they can, on some occasions, be the only effective model for 
      research where responses to agents is too complex to be modelled in any other way. 
      Such animal models provide key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and responses 
      to local, national and international health security incidents, protecting the population from existing 
      and emerging health threats.

      The animal work conducted at the 3 UKHSA sites provides an essential 
      capability for health security as well as opportunities for scientific 
      advancement aligned to UKHSA’s mission of interest to R&D funders internationally. 
      UKHSA has substantial experience in assisting in the development of countermeasures 
      to protect the population from health threats.

      UKHSA Porton also includes Porton Biopharma Limited (PBL), which focusses on the quality-assured development 
      of life-saving biopharmaceuticals. PBL manufacture the licenced childhood leukaemia therapy Erwinase, and the UK’s licenced anthrax vaccine.

        <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">UKHSA Animal Usage Statistics</h3>
       <p>
        Across the 3 sites using animals in their research, an average of 3400 animals are typically used per year. 
        This is less than 6% of the usage of the top 10 UK organisations that performed the most animal research, 
        which reported the use of over 60,580 (10th) to 223,787 (1st) animals in 2023.

        other European nations.
       </p>

        <p>
          The majority of the animals used each year are mice (47%), followed by guinea pigs (31.5 %), hamsters (14%), 
          ferrets (3%), and non-human primates, rabbits, rats and turkeys (4.5% total) (Figure 2A). The vast proportion 
          of these animals suffer no, mild or moderate harm. UKHSA Porton uses the most animals (70%), followed by UKHSA Chilton (27%) and UKHSA Colindale (3%) (Figure 2B).
