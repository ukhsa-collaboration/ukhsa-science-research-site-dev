          The 3Rs are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in research: Replace (use alternatives to animals where possible), Reduce (use as few animals as necessary), and Refine (minimise suffering and improve welfare).

          <p>
            At UKHSA the care and conditions for animals in research are continually being refined to minimise harm and distress as much as possible. Practices are regularly assessed and updated to 
            enhance animal well being at every opportunity. Examples of refinement include housing animals in socially compatible groups wherever possible, provision of enrichment appropriate to the species 
            to encourage natural behaviours and adopting sampling techniques in line with advice from bodies such as the <a href="https://nc3rs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NC3Rs</a>. In addition, we have refined studies through the use of advanced 
            medical imaging that provides critical data whilst being non-invasive.

          <h5 class="mt-3 mb-2 red"><strong>Replacement</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Replacement is the use of non-animal alternatives in place of using animals. While suitable non-animal alternatives that completely model the complex human health responses to environmental hazards or pathogens are currently unavailable,
            UKHSA is working on multiple new approach methodologies (NAMs). This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/vdec-pre-clinical-team-helps-to-develop-organ-on-a-chip-to-protect-human-health" 
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Organ on a Chip'</a>. Systems help develop vaccines, drugs and therapeutics against a broad range of dangerous infectious diseases including MERS and Influenza virus. In the long term, we anticipate that this 
            research will accelerate the rate of development of novel medicines. In addition, we are developing and validating new cell-based tests to support animal-free chemical safety regulation.

          <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 red"><strong>Reduction</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Reduction involves minimising the number of animals used and we have established a comprehensive archive of animal blood and tissues that can be shared across the organisation to develop new technologies or apply new analysis that will enhance our interpretation of 
            previously conducted studies, removing the need for additional animals.
