          UKHSA is a research active organisation. Research, and the translation
          of its findings into innovations both inform and support public health
          policy, practice and services.

        <h2>Our research remit</h2>
        <p>
          As we protect the population, improve health and address inequalities,
          research and development (R&D) are core activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research and the translation of research findings into innovations
          actively informs and supports the delivery and transformation of
          public health policies, practices and services locally, nationally and
          internationally. This is particularly critical when preparing for,
          preventing and responding to public health emergencies.
        </p>

        <p>
          We work in partnership with university-based researchers nationally
          and internationally, research funders, the NHS, local authorities, the
          third sector and the public. Most of UKHSA's scientific programme is
          distinct from, but complementary to, the work of partner
          organisations; it is recognisable as a unique national asset because
          of the very specialist, secure facilities, other resources and skills
          we deploy.
