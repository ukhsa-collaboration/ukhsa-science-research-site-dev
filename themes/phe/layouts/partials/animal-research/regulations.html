        How Animal Research is Regulated in the UK
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has three Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies (AWERBs) located at UKHSA Porton Down, UKHSA Colindale and UKHSA Chilton.
        The AWERBs are responsible for the ethical review of all animal research conducted by UKHSA, ensuring that it is performed to high standards and in compliance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The UKHSA has overall responsibility for the implementation of ASPA and the operation of the AWERB.
        The 3 AWERBs function locally but work collaboratively to share best practice, reporting quarterly into the UKHSA Science Governance Committee.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Use of animals for research in the UK is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA)
        This stipulates that animal research can only be performed under a specified Project Licence (PPL),
        within an organisation with a Place Establishment Licence (PEL), and by individuals holding a Personal Licence (PIL).
        ASPA is implemented and regulated by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) with the Home Office.
        More information on ASPA and its operation can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">One requirement of the ASPA is to have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) to ensure that the use of animals is carefully considered,
        justified and performed to high standards; all opportunities for reduction, refinement and replacement (the 3Rs) are implemented and the four commitments of the understanding Animal
        Research (UAR) <a href="https://understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/commitments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commitments</a> are upheld.
        UKHSA is committed to the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in animal research.
        This means that we aim to replace animals with non-animal alternatives wherever possible, reduce the number of animals used in research, and refine our procedures to minimise any suffering or distress experienced by the animals.
        More information on the 3Rs can be found <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/the-3rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In addition, there is guidance on the responsible acquisition and use of animal derived materials that are used in research, including ethical awareness and welfare considerations.
