     The PEL holder at each site has overall responsibility for the implementation of ASPA and the operation of the AWERB.
     The 3 AWERBs function locally but work collaboratively to share best practice, reporting quarterly into the UKHSA Science Governance Committee. More information can be found on

        How is Animal Research Regulated in the UK
      </h3>
      <p>
        Use of animals for research in the UK is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. 
        This stipulates that animal research can only be performed under a specified Project Licence (PPL),
        within an organisation with a Place Establishment Licence (PEL), and by individuals holding a Personal Licence (PIL). 
        ASPA is implemented and regulated by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) with the Home Office. 
        More information on ASPA and its operation can be found here.
      </p>
      <p>
        One requirement of the ASPA is to have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB)to ensure that the use 
        of animals is carefully considered, justified and performed to high standards; all opportunities for reduction, 
        refinement and replacement (the 3Rs) are implemented; and the four commitments of the Understanding Animal Research 
        (UAR) <a href="https://concordatopenness.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concordat on Openness</a> are upheld.
