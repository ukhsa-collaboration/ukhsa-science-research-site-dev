        How Animal Research is Regulated in the UK
      </h3>
      <p>
        The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has three Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies (AWERBs) located at Porton Down, Colindale and Manchester.
        The AWERBs are responsible for the ethical review of all animal research conducted by UKHSA, ensuring that it is performed to high standards and in compliance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA).
      </p>
      <p>
        The UKHSA has overall responsibility for the implementation of ASPA and the operation of the AWERB.
        The 3 AWERBs function locally but work collaboratively to share best practice, reporting quarterly into the UKHSA Science Governance Committee.

      <p>
        Use of animals for research in the UK is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
        This stipulates that animal research can only be performed under a specified Project Licence (PPL),
        within an organisation with a Place Establishment Licence (PEL), and by individuals holding a Personal Licence (PIL).
        ASPA is implemented and regulated by the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) with the Home Office.
        More information on ASPA and its operation can be found here.
