  UKHSA research. Alongside epidemiological and cell studies, animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental agents impact human health. This provides key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and incident responses to protect the population from existing and emerging health threats.

    <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">Why Animal Research is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental 
      agents impact human health (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). The biological similarities between humans and 
      other species means that they can, on some occasions, be the only effective model for 
      research where responses to agents is too complex to be modelled in any other way. 
      Such animal models provide key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and responses 
      to local, national and international health security incidents, protecting the population from existing 
      and emerging health threats.

  More specifically, animals are used within UKHSA research to:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improve methods of diagnosis and to identify the severity of new and emerging pathogens</li>
    <li>support the development of, and access to, new vaccines or therapies for the main public health threats and emerging or re-emerging diseases, including those on the UKHSA list of pathogens</li>
    <li>characterise the effects of low dose radiation on colon cancer, leukaemia, cataract, or cardiovascular disease development</li>
    <li>investigate the additional positive effects of sunlight beyond the associated benefits of vitamin D</li>
    <li>identify the potential toxicity of inhaled particles, including particulate matter and nanomaterials</li>
    <li>inform policies, interventions and messaging campaigns to better protect human health</li>
    <li>improve the management of casualties in acute radiation, chemical and other environmental incidents</li>
  </ul>
