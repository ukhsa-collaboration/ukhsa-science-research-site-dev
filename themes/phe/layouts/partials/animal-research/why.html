  UKHSA research. Alongside epidemiological and cell studies, animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental agents impact human health. This provides key scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and incident responses to protect the population from existing and emerging health threats.

    <h3 class="red d-none d-lg-block">Why Animal Research is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Animal research plays an essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical and other environmental 
      agents impact human health (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). The biological similarities between humans and 
      other species means that they can, on some occasions, be the only effective model for 
      research where responses to agents is too complex to be modelled in any other way. 
      Alongside other evolving technologies such as tissue and organ culture, the animal work conducted at the 3 UKHSA sites 
      provides an essential capability for health security as well as opportunities for scientific advancement aligned to UKHSAâ€™s mission 
     of interest to R&D funders internationally. UKHSA has substantial experience in assisting in the development of countermeasures to protect 
     the population from health threats.

  More specifically, animals are used within UKHSA research to:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improve methods of diagnosis and to identify the severity of new and emerging pathogens</li>
    <li>support the development of vaccine therapies for the main 
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-pathogen-families-research-and-development-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        public health threats
      </a>, and emerging or re-emerging diseases.</li>
    <li>characterise the effects of radiation on specific cancers and cardiovascular disease.</li>
    <li>Identify the potential toxicity of air pollutants and chemicals.</li>
    <li>identify the potential toxicity of inhaled particles, including particulate matter and nanomaterials and e-cigarette aerosols.</li>
    <li>inform policies, interventions and messaging campaigns to better protect human health</li>
    <li>improve management of casualties in acute radiation, chemical and other environmental incidents</li>
  </ul>
