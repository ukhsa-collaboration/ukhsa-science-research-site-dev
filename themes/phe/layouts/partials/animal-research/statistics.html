      reduction, refinement, and replacement (the 3Rs).The majority of the animals used each year are mice (47%), followed by guinea pigs (31.5 %), hamsters (14%), 
      ferrets (3%), and non-human primates, rabbits, rats and turkeys (4.5% total).

        Across the 3 sites  <i><strong>Fig.2</strong></i> using animals in their research, an average of 3400 animals 
        are typically used per year. This is less than 6% of the usage of the top 10 UK organisations that performed the most animal research, 
        which reported the use of over 60,580 (10th) to 223,787 (1st) animals in 2023.
