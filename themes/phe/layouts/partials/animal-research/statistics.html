      Typical Annual Animal Usage Statistics at UKHSA
    </h3> 
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <p>
      Across the 3 UKHSA sites <i>(Fig 4)</i> using animals in their research, an average of 3400 procedures are 
              typically performed on animals per year. This is less than 6&#37; of the number of procedures performed by the top 10 UK organisations carrying out the
              most animal research, which reported over 60,580 (10th) to 223,787 (1st) procedures on animals in 2023.
