        UKHSA Animal Usage Statistics
      </h3> 
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>
          Across the 3 sites using animals in their research, an average of 3400 animals 
          are typically performed on animals per year. This is less than 6&#37; of the number of procedures performed by the top 10 UK organisations carrying out the
          most animal research, which reported over 60,580 (10th) to 223,787 (1st) procedures on animals in 2023.

          At UKHSA, the majority of procedures are performed on mice (47%), followed by guinea pigs (31.5 %), hamsters (14%), ferrets (3%), and non-human primates,
          rabbits, rats and turkeys (4.5% total) (Fig 2). The vast proportion of these animals suffer no, mild or moderate harm. UKHSA Porton performs the most procedures (70&#37;), 
          followed by UKHSA Chilton (27&#37;) and UKHSA Colindale (3&#37;). The majority of the animals used each year are mice (47&#37;), 
          followed by, followed by UKHSA Chilton (27&#37;) and UKHSA Colindale (3&#37;) (<strong><em>Fig 3</em></strong>).
