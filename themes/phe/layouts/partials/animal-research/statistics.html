       <p>
        Across the 3 sites  <i><strong>Fig.2</strong></i> using animals in their research, an average of 3400 animals 
        are typically used per year. This is less than 6% of the usage of the top 10 UK organisations that performed the most animal research, 
        which reported the use of over 60,580 (10th) to 223,787 (1st) animals in 2023.

          The vast majority of these animals suffer no, mild or moderate harm. At UKHSA, most of our animal research takes place at Porton Down, followed 
          by our Chilton site.  Mice are the most commonnly used animal model, followed by guinea pigs and hamsters (<strong><em>Fig 3</em></strong>).
