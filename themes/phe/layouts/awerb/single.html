        <p>
          Alongside epidemiological and cell studies, animal research plays an
          essential role in understanding how infectious, radiological, chemical 
          other environmental agents impact human health (Figure 1). The biologica
          similarities between humans and other species means they can, on some occasions, 
          be the only effective model for research where responses to agents is technology
          complex to be modelled in any other way.  Such animal models provide key 
          scientific evidence that informs interventions, policies and responses to local,
          national and international health security incidents, protecting the population 
          from existing and emerging health threats.

          New students normally start around the beginning of each academic
          year. Recruitment of students generally takes place between March and
          July each year. Projects are advertised through specific academic
          partners and sometimes via FindaPhD.com. Links to any projects open
          for applications will be regularly updated on this page.
