    <p>
      The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) uses animal tesing in specific and carefully 
      considered circumstances to support our public health research and protection responses 
      to infectious diseases, vaccines and evironmenal hazzards. Within our vaccine and therapy 
      development, animals are used to assess the safety and efficacy of new treatments for diseases 
      like influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, meningococcal disease, neonatal sepsis and 
      other infectious diseases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with public and private sector partners, we conduct and coordinate
      behavioural science and insights advice, guidance, evaluation and
      research. Our research has a track record of peer-reviewed publications,
      dissemination and translation. We contribute to the Scientific Advisory
      Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and its behavioural science sub-group SPI-B,
      and work with a range of cross-Government partners and networks and
      international working groups and bodies.
