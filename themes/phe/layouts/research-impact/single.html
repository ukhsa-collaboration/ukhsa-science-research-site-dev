          At the heart of our research organisation, lies a commitment to making a real difference locally, nationally and globally.  We believe that research is more than discovery; it
          is a catalyst for change, a bridge between knowledge and action and a force for societal progress.  The UKHSA's commitment to creating meaningful impact is identified as one of 
          our three core values in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/646c93e6a726f6000ccebc20/UKHSA_Science_strategy.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:aliceblue;" rel="noopener"

        <p>
          To support these principles we have created an open access policy and have implemented an insitutional repository, 
          where the peer-reviewed outputs of research can be made open access for the benefit of public health and society.
        </p>

        <p>
          These benefits include the ability to rapidly disseminate and provide
          a global equity of access to the outputs of research, which can aid
          evidence-based public health policy and practice, and the development
          of new research.

          On 1 April 2021, Public Health England (PHE) was replaced by the UK

          system. If you have a question relating to your involvement in a
