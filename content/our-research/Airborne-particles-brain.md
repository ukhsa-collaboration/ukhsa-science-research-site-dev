<p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between air pollution and brain diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  Our research explores how airborne particles may impact the brain by affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), through an interdisciplinary approach, in collaboration with scientists on the <a style="color:white" href="https://www.harwellcampus.com/" target="_blank"> (Harwell Science and Innovation Campus).</a></p>

<p>Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) exposed blood vessel cells (as a BBB model) to diesel exhaust particals and imaged them using ion eam scanning electron microscopy combined with conofocal microscopy at the <a style="color:white" href="https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> (Central Laser Facility).</a>  This high-resolution 3D imaging revealed that particles interacted with cell membrane as well as being internalised into cells.  To understand how these particles move through biological barriers, neutron scattering experiments were performed at the <a style="color:white" href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> (ISIS Neutron and Muon).</a> to identify the effects on cellular lipid membranes, which will be further investigated in future experiments.</p>
