<p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between air pollution and brain diseases like Alzheimer&#39's and Parkinson&#39's.</p>
<p>Our Research explores how airborne particles may impact the brain by affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), through an interdisciplinary approach in collaboration with scientists at national facilities on the <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.harwellcampus.com" target="_blank">Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.</a></p>

<p>Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) exposed blood vessel cells (as a BBB model) to diesel exhaust particles and imaged them using focussed ion beam and scanning electron microscopy combined with confocal microscopy at the <a href="https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Octopus-new.aspx" target="_blank">Octopus Facility part of the Central Laser Facility.</a></p>
<p>Analysis of three dimensional ultrastructural images revealed interactions between nano-sized particles and plasma membrane.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into how inhaled changesparticulate matter interacts with and affects BBB function, with a specific focus on impact to the plasma membrane.</p>
