<p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between air pollution and brain diseases like Alzheimer&#39's and Parkinson&#39's.</p>
<p>Our Research explores how airborne particles may impact the brain by affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), through an interdisciplinary approach in collaboration with scientists at national facilities on the <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.harwellcampus.com" target="_blank">Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.</a></p>

<p>Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) exposed blood vessel cells (as a BBB model) to diesel exhaust particles and imaged them using focussed ion beam and scanning electron microscopy combined with confocal microscopy at the <a href="https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Octopus-new.aspx" target="_blank">Octopus Facility part of the Central Laser Facility.</a></p>
<p>Analysis of three dimensional ultrastructural images revealed interactions between nano-sized particles and plasma membrane.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into how inhaled changesparticulate matter interacts with and affects BBB function, with a specific focus on impact to the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>The hazards of staying out too long in the sun are well known â€“ sunburn, increasing risk of skin cancer, skin ageing, to name a few. However, <i>in vitro</i> laboratory research from UKHSA (and independently researched by others), shows that some sunlight activates nitric oxide, a molecule in the skin known to reduce blood pressure <i>(Liu 2014)</i>. High blood pressure affects around 25&percnt; of UK adults and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease; therefore, strategies to alleviate this burden of disease are a key priority <a style="color:white" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-combating-high-blood-pressure/health-matters-combating-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"> (PHE Guidance 2017).</a></p>

<p>Nitric oxide is a small molecule that is released in the skin after exposure to ultraviolet light (present in sunlight) and acts to expand the blood vessels in the body. This lowers blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The exact size of effect sunlight could have on cardiovascular health by this mechanism is unknown, however early clinical trials, epidemiological and laboratory data are supportive of this protective mechanism <i>(Liu 2014, Pelegrino 2020, Weller 2020, Weller 2022).</i></p>

<p>Recently published work by researchers at UKHSA has shown that low exposures to natural sunlight (around 10 minutes on a clear summer day) can expand blood vessels <i>in vitro</i>. Importantly, these doses of sunlight produced no detrimental effects to the cells. It may be possible to be protected against the harmful effects of sunlight while taking advantage of the benefits to our health that sunlight has to offer, though further work is needed to study these effects in humans. Research on this area continues under the <a href="https://crth.hpru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Chemical and Radiation Threats and Hazards</a> and in collaboration with partner universities.</a></p>
