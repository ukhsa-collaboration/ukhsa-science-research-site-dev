excerpt: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was asked to carry out protective behaviours that would prevent the spread of illness. While people had been asked to isolate in previous outbreaks, the impact of quarantining on psychological wellbeing was unclear. A rapid review was carried out to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic."

<p>The rapid review systematically searched scientific articles and found 24 studies that investigated the effect of quarantine on psychological wellbeing.  Most studies included in the review found that quarantining had a significant negative impact on wellbeing. Factors that negatively impacted wellbeing included having a lack of supplies, resources, income, inadequate information, and higher health anxiety, boredom, and stigma of having the virus.</p>
<p>There was an increased  impact on psychological wellbeing for those quarantining for a longer time. Findings led to a series of recommendations on how to implement quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included giving a clear explanation of how long and why people would need to self-isolate, ensuring people had basic supplies, and trying to minimise the impact on people&apos;s income and employment.</p>
<p>The results of this study were published as a scientific research paper (which has now been cited over 10,000 times, making it one of the most highly cited articles in the history of King&apos;s College London) and shared with policy makers to support and inform the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The review was delivered by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) <a href="https://epr.hpru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response at King's College London</a>, a collaboration between the UK Health Security Agency (previously Public Health England), King&apos;s College London and the University of East Anglia. A further rapid review investigated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32334182/" target ="_blank">how to improve adherence to quarantine</a>.</p>
<p>These reviews were subsequently updated to investigate adherence to self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic affected wellbeing (see Further Reading).</p>
