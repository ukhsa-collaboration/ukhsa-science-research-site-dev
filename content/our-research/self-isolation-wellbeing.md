<p>Increasing evidence suggests a link between self-isolation and wellbeing</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was asked to carry out protective behaviours that would prevent the spread of illness.  While people had been asked to isolate in previous outbreaks, the impact of quarantining on psychological wellbeing was unclear.  A <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8/fulltext#:~:text=Most%20reviewed%20studies%20reported%20negative,%2C%20financial%20loss%2C%20and%20stigma." target="_blank">Rapid Review</a></p>was carreid out to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</a></p>

<p>Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency exposed blood vessel cells (as a BBB model) to diesel exhaust particles and imaged them using focussed ion beam and scanning electron microscopy combined with confocal microscopy at the <a href="https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Octopus-new.aspx" target="_blank">Octopus Facility (part of the Central Laser Facility).</a></p>
<p>Analysis of three-dimensional ultrastructural images revealed interactions between particles and subcellular compartments, with nano-sized particles particularly associated with the plasma membrane. To further investigate the interactions between nano-sized particles and plasma membrane, neutron scattering experiments were performed at <a href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk" target =_blank>ISIS Neutron and Muon</a> to identify the effects on cellular membrane dynamics.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into how inhaled particulate matter interacts with and affects BBB function, with a specific focus on the impact to the plasma membrane.</p>
