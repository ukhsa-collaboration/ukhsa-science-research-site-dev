<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was asked to carry out protective behaviours that would prevent the spread of illness.  While people had been asked to isolate in previous outbreaks, the impact of quarantining on psychological wellbeing was unclear.  A <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8/fulltext#:~:text=Most%20reviewed%20studies%20reported%20negative,%2C%20financial%20loss%2C%20and%20stigma" target="_blank">rapid review</a>was carried out to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The rapid review systematically searched scientific articles and found 24 studies that investigated the effect of quarantine on psychological wellbeing particularly for those quarantining for longer periods of time. Factors that negatively impacted wellbeing included having a lack of supplies, resources, income, inadequate information, higher health anxiety, boredom and stigma of having the virus.</p>
<p>These findings led to a series of recommendations for how to implement quarantine, including  clear explanations for how long and why people would have to quarantine, ensuring people had basic supplies, and  trying to minimise the impact on people’s income and employment."</p>

<p>The results of this study were published as a scientific research paper (which has now been cited over 10,000 times, making it one of the most highly cited articles in the history of King’s College London) and shared with policy makers to support and inform the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The review was delivered by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Emergency Preparedness and Response | Health Protection Research Unit | Kings College  London, a collaboration between the UK Health Security Agency (previously Public Health England), Kings College London and the University of East Anglia.</p>  

<p>A further rapid review investigated how to improve adherence to quarantine.
These reviews were subsequently updated to address adherence to self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether self-isolation  affected wellbeing (see further reading).</p>
